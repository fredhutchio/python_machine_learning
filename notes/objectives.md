## Class 1: Basic Data Understanding and Preparation: Data Import, Cleaning, Visualization, and Feature Engineering

* Import a simple dataset and explore different qualitative and quantitative aspects of the data
* Perform simple cleaning and visualization with single variables
* Prepare the data for further analysis by engineering new features (columns) from existing numeric and categorical features
* Discuss how writing functions and classes can save considerable effort by allowing us to maintain control over inputs and avoid repetitious editing.

## Class 2: Case Study in Regression

* Visualize single variables in different ways and plot continuous features against categorical features to highlight notable patterns (this lesson isn't about plotting specifically, but I'm hoping the plots here will help you create your own)
* Engineer new features (columns) for our dataset using existing features and/or specific functions written for that purpose
* Set-up, fit, and evaluate different models for our problem, including linear regression and random forests
* Understand the basic structure and some of the strengths and draw-backs of the two models we fitted

## Class 3: Logistic Regression in Classification

* Place logistic regression in the taxonomy of ML algorithms
* Explain the key differences and similarities between logistic and linear regression.
* Fit and interpret a logistic regression model in scikit-learn
* Interpret the coefficients of logistic regression, using odds ratio

## Class 4: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

Explain why we might want to create a lower-dimension representation of a dataset.
Explain the curse of dimensionality
Explain the conceptual basis of PCA (principal component analysis) and what is meant by subsequent PCs
Describe how PCA is used in practice and when to avoid using it.

Conflicted about leaving out any examples of clustering. Need to determine - what are the most common uses for ml in biology. Which algorithms are people using? 

Can we combine classification and regression class? The algorithms are really similar. Could tie together with Random forest
